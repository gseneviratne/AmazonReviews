So, I'm sure this game is for some try hard folks. But for me and too me this game was hard as hell. I mean I died 3 times right at the first of the game of no fault of my own. The fighting system is clunky and hard to get used to. Also, it seems like you get throw to the wolves too soon without much instruction beyond that. It has a nice play for realism but thats it. The rest is just... figure it out though trial and error. If I were able to make it easier or have a better fighting system. Then maybe it would be better but.. But like I said. This game is hard as hell.

Great rpg, awesome graphics, difficult learning curve especially with combat, but have been playing for 30 hours now and have yet to have one successful lockpick attempt even on very easy. The forums all comment on how difficult it is, could impact game completion otherwise would have been 5 stars

Pistole giocattolo a prova di bambino. Prese per passatempo famigliare,mio figlio di 4 anni le adora ed è invidiato dagli amici, ma anche noi adulti le apprezziamo parecchio... genitori degli amici compresi! Super resistenti, lavorano bene anche in spazi ampi ( ci abbiamo giocato nel bosco). Sono cadute spesso senza riportare danni. Bello il fatto di poter cambiare il colore della pistola in base alla squadra. Suoni coinvolgenti. La pettorina e il filo non ingombrano eccessivamente durante il gioco ed il peso non è eccessivo anche per i bimbi. Intuitive come uso: dopo un certo numero di colpi bisogna ricaricare tirando indietro la canna della pistola che è di dimensioni abbastanza grandi ( circa 30 cm). Il colore della pettorina passa da verde ad arancione a rosso quando si viene colpiti. Quando le abbiamo prese il prezzo era 50 euro, e certamente sono state un affare.
